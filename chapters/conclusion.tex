\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

In this paper we presented one variation of the classical online secretary
problem where the idea originated from the famous television shows.
We also expressed this problem in the perspective of 
weighted online bipartite matching.

The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of online decentralized
algorithm. We have proposed two simple decentralized algorithms to solve
the weighted online bipartite matching problem based on the optimal
algorithm for classical online secretary problem -- stopping rule.

For more specific models,
we use the simultaneous stopping rule to solve the problem where the
correlation between edge weights are nearly independent and
use the simultaneous stopping rule with $m$ slots where the firms' view
on applicants are nearly identical.
And we have shown respectively that these two algorithms 
are nearly optimal within a constant factor in different scenarios 
for firms and applicants.
Then we intuitively describe the relation between the market's setting
and the strategy that each firm adopts under this framework.
