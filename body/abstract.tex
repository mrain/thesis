Inspired by the famous TV shows these years -- ``The Voice of China".
We investigate a new generalization of classical online secretary problem:
given weights between a list of firms and applicant, the goal is to design
an online algorithm for each firm to
find a maximum weighted matching in an online setting with the assumption
that the incoming order of applicants is uniform at random. 
One additional restriction is that, the algorithm should be decentralized.
During the execution no communication is allowed between the firms and there
is no supervisor doing such an assignment.
In this paper we proposed two decentralized algorithms based on the 
classical stopping rule which optimally solved the online secretary 
problem. Then we examined their performances in general case respectively 
and showed their capabilities and shortnesses in several 
different scenarios. Which gives us the insight on how firms would perform
in different market settings and a framework of the firms' strategies.
