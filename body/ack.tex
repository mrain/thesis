First of all, I have to thank to my research supervisor, 
Dr.\ Pinyan Lu from Microsoft Research Asia and Dr.\ Ning Chen from
Nanyang Technological University. Without their assistance this paper
would have never been accomplished.

Thanks to my supervisor in Shanghai Jiao Tong University -- Prof.\ Yong Yu
who has always been nice and kind
for his dedications to my study and other affairs.
It was he who guide me to the research area of computer science.

Thanks to my classmates Peihan Miao, Youer Pu, Xiangru Huang, Xinchen Yan
as well as Xiaohui Bei and Andrea Pisoni
for their company during my internship at Singapore where most of the work
was done. We have had a wonderful time there.

And I'll give my special thanks to Peihan Miao who was my partner.
We had been discussing the massive details and she has always been patient
while listenning and correcting my mistakes.
